  title: "Airtable Driven Human Services Data API"
  description: "This is a specification describing the Human Services Data API, using the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). This has been extracted from the Ohana API deployment, but will be standardized to refer to the universal standard that will apply to any HSDS/A compliant API. This particular version is just a facade for an Airtable version of the system, which proxies the Airtable API."
